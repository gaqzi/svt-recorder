2012-06-04 Björn Andersson <ba@sanitarium.se>, v1.0.0

	SVT has changed their website and thus the way data is fetched.
	Changed to the new format which basically is the same for both
	Play and Rapport now.

	Added Nokogiri as a dependency because REXML doesn't handle broken HTML
	as well. Sadly SVTPlay.se didn't have valid code that made REXML barf.

	Since I'll most likely not add support for RTMP streams on my own
	I'm calling this 1.0 and possible support for RTMP will be
	another major release at that point.

2012-01-15 Björn Andersson <ba@sanitarium.se>, v0.9.6

	Patch received from Anders Eurenius (aes on Github) that will
	retry a chunk download if it times out.

	Thanks Anders!
